# Visualizing USGS Earthquake Data
This project visualizes Earthquake Data collected by the United States Geological Survey. Specifically, we've visulized data on every earthquake from the last seven days. Every earthquake is represented on this map, with each quake colored and sized by its respective magnitude.  

The map and visualization can be seen here:
